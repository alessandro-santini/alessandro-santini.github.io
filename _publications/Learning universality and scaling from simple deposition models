title: "Learning universality and scaling from simple deposition models"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We use deposition models of kinetic roughening of a growing surface to introduce the concepts of universality and scaling and to analyze the qualitative and quantitative role of different parameters. In particular, we focus on two classes of models where the deposition is accompanied by a local relaxation process within a distance δ. The models are in the Edwards-Wilkinson universality class, but the role of δ is nontrivial.'
